On Wednesday, February 12, 2025, I attended the Tech Minds Meetup at the Walter Dods Jr. RISE Center with two of my friends. This event brought together over 40 software engineers, company founders, product managers, and tech professionals from both local and global companies. Students were invited to present and pitch software ideas to industry experts and engage in 15-minute discussions with them.

## Aaron Boodman: Company Founder
I had the opportunity to speak with Aaron Boodman, founder and CEO of Rocicorp, a company dedicated to creating high-quality tools for web developers. We discussed his role as a company founder and the journey that led him to establish Rocicorp. I was interested in the programming languages he uses in his work, to which he explained that TypeScript and Python are his primary choices. He shared his insights on the strengths and challenges of these languages, explaining that while TypeScript is relatively easy to learn, many of its tools are a bit outdated and difficult to work with.

## Brody Uehara: Software Engineer
Next, I spoke with Brody Uehara, a software engineer at kWh Analytics. As a graduate of UH Manoa, where I am currently studying, it was reassuring to connect with someone who pursued the same degree I am working toward and successfully built a career in the field. We discussed his job responsibilities, his favorite programming languages, and the courses he took at UH that helped prepare him for his career. It was an insightful conversation that provided perspective on the transition from academia to industry.

## Ryley Higa: Machine Learning Engineer
Finally, I spoke with Ryley Higa, a machine learning engineer at Sumo Logic. He shared details about his role and his academic background in Computer Engineering. Given his experience with AI, I asked for his thoughts on the increasing acceptance and encouragement of AI tools in computer science education. He explained that AI is simply another tool that can assist with coding but emphasized the importance of remaining skeptical of it, as it is prone to making mistakes. Hearing his perspective as someone who works with AI regularly was both enlightening and thought-provoking.

## Takeaways
Overall, the Tech Minds Meetup was an enriching and inspiring experience. It provided a valuable glimpse into real-world careers in computer science and allowed me to engage with professionals who have successfully navigated the same academic path I am currently pursuing. Hearing their experiences and insights has made me enthusiastic for my studies and my future in the CS field.
