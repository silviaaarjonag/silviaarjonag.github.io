## The Importance of Coding Standards: More Than Just Style
When people think of coding standards, they often focus on minor formatting rules (don't worry—I thought this too). But true coding standards go farther than aesthetics, they improve readability, maintainability, and even help us learn a language more effectively. Actually, I am starting to believe that coding standards can be a very useful tool for mastering a new language.

## Coding Standards as a Learning Tool
TypeScript helps catch many potential bugs at compile time, but coding standards add another layer of protection. They enforce practices like avoiding the any type and preferring readonly properties. These rules guide developers, such as myself, toward writing more predictable code.

## First Impressions of ESLint in VS Code
Using ESLint with TypeScript in VS Code was frustrating. I am still new at TypeScript and having only a background in Java and C did not help. So, adding another layer of protection to catch errors made my coding take longer. Errors and warnings popped up constantly, forcing me to rewrite what I thought was functional code. All of this being said, I am realizing these weren’t just little nitpicks, they were actually preventing bad habits.

Coding standards have, against what I believed, started pushing me toward better alternatives in my code. Over time, I'm seeing how these rules lead to more effective and maintainable code.

## Painful but Useful: The Value of Strict Standards
Fixing ESLint errors can be tedious, as I have learned in several assignments, but the benefits outweigh the frustration. Enforcing consistent practices makes code easier to read and debug. In team settings, I think it will eliminate unnecessary debates over style, allowing groups to focus on logic.

Also, coding standards extend beyond tools like ESLint. They include principles like:
- Using strict typing to avoid runtime errors
- Handling null and undefined values explicitly
- Structuring code for maintainability

## Conclusion
If I had to choose one engineering practice that I dislike, but improves the quality of code substantially, I would choose coding standards. While the rules feel frustrating at first, they lead to better code. Instead of seeing these standards as something that holds us back, we should see them as tools for writing professional and high-quality software.
