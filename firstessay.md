## How It Began

I originally was only an Astrophysics major, but halfway through my freshman year, I declared Computer Science as a second major. I did this after starting my first ASTR class, which was intro to research. In this class, I learned about astrophysical research and exactly how much it involved programming and software engineering.

Now, almost 3/4 of the way done with my sophomore year, I am taking ICS 314: Intro to Software Development. I have discovered more about software engineering and looked into how this would apply to future endeavors.

## Future Aspirations

One of my main goals is to improve my ability to design efficient systems. Given my double major, there are opportunities to use computational methods to analyze astronomical data and model physical phenomena. Some of these include N-body simulations and Numerical Relativity, all run by differnt computers and programs. So, by learning these advanced techniques, I'll be able to more effectively find solutions to problems at hand in terms of astrophysical research.

I also want to develop strong collaboration and leadership skills. Working at different companies has shown me the importance of clear communication and teamwork. As I progress, I hope to work on projects with other scientists, engineers, and researchers. Finally, my goal is to get involved in open-source contributions and hackathons to further strengthen my ability to work in teams.

## Final Statement

Ultimately, I want to use technology to explore the unknown. My goal is to apply my skills in software engineering to make meaningful contributions to both science and engineering. Through continuous learning and hands-on experience, my goal is to become a software engineer capable of driving progress in astrophysical research
