Software engineering is a field that includes problem-solving, logic, and creativity. Iâ€™m drawn to it because of its ability to solve problems across various fields, ranging from astrophysics to AI. With a foundation in Java, Python, and C/C++, I have a solid grasp of data structures and software design.

One of my main goals is to improve my ability to design efficient systems. Given my double major, there are opportunities to use computational methods to analyze astronomical data and model physical phenomena. Learning advanced programming techniques will help me tackle these complex computational challenges more effectively.

I also want to develop strong collaboration and leadership skills. Working at different companies has shown me the importance of clear communication and teamwork. As I progress, I hope to work on projects with scientists, engineers, and researchers. Getting involved in open-source contributions and hackathons will further strengthen my ability to work in teams.

Ultimately, I want to use technology to explore the unknown. My goal is to apply my skills in software engineering to make meaningful contributions to both science and engineering. Through continuous learning and hands-on experience, my goal is to become a software engineer capable of driving progress in astrophysical research
