summary: "A game of Tic-Tac-Toe I created for a project in ICS 211."
---

My Tic-Tac-Toe project was a classic implementation of the game where a user could play against a computer. The game featured a simple yet interactive interface, allowing the player to place their moves on a 3x3 grid while the computer responded with its own moves. The project focused on reinforcing fundamental programming concepts such as game logic, user input handling, and algorithmic efficiency.

In this project, I was responsible for the entire process, from designing the game logic to implementing the user interface. I handled all aspects of the project, including developing the turn-based mechanics and creating the conditions for detecting wins, losses, and draws. Additionally, I worked on ensuring a smooth gaming experience.

This project provided valuable insights into problem-solving and algorithmic efficiency. I learned how to structure a game application, break down complex logic into manageable components, and improve my debugging skills. Beyond technical skills, the experience strengthened my ability to write modular and maintainable code. This assignment was a rewarding challenge that solidified my interest in programming.
