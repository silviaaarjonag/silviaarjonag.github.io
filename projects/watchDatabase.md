summary: "A console application about Watches that I created for a project in ICS 211."
---

The WatchStore project is a simple console application that allows users to manage a collection of watches. Users can add new watches, remove existing ones, and view watches under a certain price or all watches in the store. Each watch has details such as a serial number, price, description, and type. The program includes basic error handling to ensure valid input information and are told when when the store is full or a watch is not found.

In this project, I was responsible for writing the entire program. I created the main menu that allows users to choose different options, and I implemented the logic for adding, removing, and displaying watches. I also handled input validation to make sure the program responds correctly to invalid inputs. This included checking for duplicate serial numbers when adding watches and managing the storeâ€™s watch inventory by shifting watches when one is removed.

From this experience, I learned how to manage a list of items and handle user input in a way that keeps the program running smoothly. I also gained experience in writing clear, easy-to-understand code that allows for simple interactions with the user. The project taught me how important it is to plan for different situations, such as handling invalid input and ensuring the program runs as expected even when something goes wrong.
